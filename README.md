# Predicting Media Memorability
## Overview

Predicting Media Memorability task,which is proposed as part of the MediaEval 2018 Benchmarking Initiative for Multimedia Evaluation. Participants were expected to design systems that automatically predict memorability scores for videos, which reflect the probability of a video being remembered.

As a solution for the above task,an attempt has been made to predict the memorability scores of the video, probability of video being recognized, using different machine learning algorithms on semantic features such as Captions â€“ video description. Different experiments were carried out to predict memorability of videos using basic machine learning algorithms to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with optimized parameters.
